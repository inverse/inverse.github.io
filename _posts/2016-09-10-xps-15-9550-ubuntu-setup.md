title: Setting up Ubuntu 16.04 on Dell XPS 15 (9550)

I recently recieved an Dell XPS 15 (9550) as a replacement for older XPS 15 which has some unresolved USB issues. At work I have been using Ubuntu as my workstation and I wanted to replicate this setup at home too.

## Backup Windows licence

The first thing I did was to backup the Windows licence information for the case when I ever did decide to go back to Windows land. For this I used [ProduKey][1] from NirSoft which easily allowed me to do so.

## Getting the machine ready

You will want to disable secure boot in the BIOS so that we will be able to install Ubuntu and the required nvidia drivers to take full advantage of the dedicated GPU.

## Installing Ubuntu 16.04

The USB installation process was relatively pain free and the system was installed within a matter of minutes.

### Improving display

The default settings on this 4K screen look far to small for my eyes. You can adjust this in the display settings by changing the scale factor. `1.5` works well for me but it's a personal preference.

### Enabling bluetooth

I soon noticed that bluetooth was not working and researched a bit on how to fix this and it seemed to point to a [missing firmware file][0]. The file can be obtained [here][5]. Once downloaded copy to `/lib/firmware/brcm/` and reboot the system.

### Setting up nvidia

Out of the box the nvidia GPU drivers are not installed. You can use the default nivdia drivers outlined in the "Additional drivers" settings but I had more luck with the `nvidia-367` series.

`sudo apt install nvidia-367`

I recommend installing `nvidia-prime` too as it'll enable you to switch between the Intel and Nvidia GPU easily from within unity.

`sudo apt install nvidia-prime`

However switching does require a whole login/logout cycle which makes switching a bit of a pain. Others have setup bumblebee and enable the dedicated GPU on a per app basis. I've not had a chance to explore this setup yet.

#### Trooubleshooting

I've noticed this previously that sometimes the drivers fail to load correctly and upon boot you're greeted with a black screen. To revert these changes boot into a kernel recovery mode and run `apt remove nvidia-*` and reboot. More information can be found [here][6].
